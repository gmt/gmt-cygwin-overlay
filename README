For this to work you need to

o Put this profile in a directory directly under ${EPREFIX} (below I assume you used "overlay")

o put this into your PORTDIR_OVERLAY variable in make.conf i.e.:

	PORTDIR_OVERLAY="${EPREFIX}/overlay"

o create ${EPREFIX}/repos.conf as follows:

	[DEFAULT]
	eclass-overrides = gmt_cygwin_overlay

o add the following to make.conf:

	PORTAGE_RSYNC_EXTRA_OPTS="--exclude=/metadata/cache"

o invoke eselect as follows:

	PORTDIR=${EPREFIX}/overlay eselect profile set 1

  but this requires a working eselect -- if you don't have that you can just

	cd ${EPREFIX}
  	rm make.profile
	ln -s ../overlay/profiles/prefix/windows/cygwin/1.7/x86/gmtoverlay make.profile


o you will need a working 'rebase' and 'peflags' in your $PATH

once those conditions are met, with any luck, you should be able to bootstrap cygwin prefix
by following the recipe at http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/gentoo-alt/prefix/bootstrap-solaris.xml
however, don't be surprised if shit breaks.

if you are having trouble bootstrapping python due to the chicken-and-egg issue with
the gcc-config -> python -> gcc -> gcc-config recursive dependency, try emerging python with
the "cygbootstraphack" USE-flag.
