For this to work you need to

o Put this profile in a directory directly under ${EPREFIX} (below I assume you used "overlay")

o put this into your PORTDIR_OVERLAY variable in make.conf i.e.:

	PORTDIR_OVERLAY="${EPREFIX}/overlay"

o create ${EPREFIX}/repos.conf as follows:

	[DEFAULT]
	eclass-overrides = gmt_cygwin_overlay

o add the following to make.conf:

	PORTAGE_RSYNC_EXTRA_OPTS="--exclude=/metadata/cache"

o invoke eselect as follows:

	PORTDIR=${EPREFIX}/overlay eselect profile set 1

  but this requires a working eselect -- if you don't have that you can just

	cd ${EPREFIX}
  	rm make.profile
	ln -s ../overlay/profiles/prefix/windows/cygwin/1.7/x86/gmtoverlay make.profile


o you will need a working 'rebase' and 'peflags' in your $PATH

once those conditions are met, with any luck, you should be able to bootstrap cygwin prefix
by following the recipe at http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/gentoo-alt/prefix/bootstrap-solaris.xml
however, don't be surprised if shit breaks.

on second thought, the correct recipe is probably to start following the recipe at the above url,
go until something breaks (it won't take long), install this overlay according to the bullet points
above, and then proceed with the recipe.  you may also find some usefull stuff on the gentoo-wiki
(not the official one).

if you are having trouble bootstrapping python due to a chicken-and-egg issue with
gcc-config -> python -> gcc -> gcc-config recursive dependencies, try emerging python with
the "cygbootstraphack" USE-flag.
