o The profile should be reparented at some point so that the
  paths are compatible with a default layman installation

o It turns out that the CHOST setting I have used is an historical
  relic that makes no sense.  I don't know why I didn't figure this
  out sooner; anyhow, instead of 

    CHOST="i686-pc-cygwin1.7"

  we can just have

    CHOST="i686-pc-cygwin"

  and all the various work-arounds in this overlay pertaining to "1.7"
  -- mostly various patches changing bash case statements from, i.e.:

    - *-foo*|*-bar*|*-cygwin|*-baz*)
    + *-foo*|*-bar*|*-cygwin*|*-baz*)

  -- can be abandoned.  yay!  Unfortunately, doing so is going to pretty
  much fsck up my half-completed bootstrap process and I'm too lazy/entrenched
  to comfortably do so just yet.  So for now I guess I am stuck with it.  boo!
