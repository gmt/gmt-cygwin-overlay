o The profile should be reparented at some point so that the
  paths are compatible with a default layman installation

o It turns out that the CHOST setting I have used is an historical
  relic that makes no sense.  I don't know why I didn't figure this
  out sooner; anyhow, instead of 

    CHOST="i686-pc-cygwin1.7"

  we can just have

    CHOST="i686-pc-cygwin"

  and all the various work-arounds in this overlay pertaining to "1.7"
  -- mostly various patches changing bash case statements from, i.e.:

    - *-foo*|*-bar*|*-cygwin|*-baz*)
    + *-foo*|*-bar*|*-cygwin*|*-baz*)

  -- can be abandoned.  yay!  Unfortunately, doing so is going to pretty
  much fsck up my half-completed bootstrap process and I'm too lazy/entrenched
  to comfortably do so just yet.  So for now I guess I am stuck with it.  boo!

o When directly merging a formerly cygdll_protected file, we should wipe out
  any in-limbo files -- otherwise the administrator with automatically revert
  to some older version when they run cygdll-update!!!  This means we need to
  check the cygdlldict for every regular file that is merged.
  
o Some thought will eventually need to be put into just how big the cygdll
  protections database is going to get.  If its getting out of hand, we might
  consider embedded mysql or something.  The cygdll protections db is flushed
  much more frequently than the configdb and potentially could get large if
  someone is running big emerges (but wouldn't this cause breakage anyhow
  due to bad BDEPs?)... something to keep an eye on anyhow.

o Somehow we want to get rid of ultra-prefixify, it is a horrible abomination.
  One approach would be to build our own cygwin DLL and launcher utility
  (to ensure that no other cygwin DLL gets pulled in).  Armed with
  a cygwin1.dll ebuild (+ whatever else is in cygwin base package),
  we could put in some prefixification patches to avoid i.e. /bin/sh and
  redirect to EPREFIX.

o libtool patches for fork/subshell avoidance

o fix libtool-2.4.2.ebuild to be merely horrible instead of satanically,
  rediculously, unspeakably gross.
