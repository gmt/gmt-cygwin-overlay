# "must-overlay" dept.: These are here to make sure that
# only the overlay ebuilds are used for packages which
# contain essential patches, even if new versions get
# pulled in via a sync.  "package.unmask" entries for
# each of these must be maintained to be in sync with
# what is actually provided by the overlay, or else
# the package would simply be globally masked, which is
# not the idea behind these entries.  Note: this can
# and should go away once we stop accepting x86-linux
# keywords by default (since we can achieve this the
# correct way, by keywording).  Please alphabetize!
