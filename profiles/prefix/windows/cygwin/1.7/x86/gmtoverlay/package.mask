# only the overlay ebuilds are used for packages which
# contain essential patches, even if new versions get
# pulled in via a sync.  "package.unmask" entries for
# each of these must be maintained to be in sync with
# what is actually provided by the overlay, or else
# the package would simply be globally masked, which is
# not the idea behind these entries.
